We're very sorry, but it wasn't possible to send your letter to
<?=$values['recipient_name']?>, your <?=$values['recipient_position']?>.

Unfortunately, sometimes emails can't get through. It might be down to a server
problem at the other end, or something unexpected in our system - we'll look
into it.

Meanwhile, we've attached a copy of your letter to the bottom of this email, so
that you can print it out and send it by other means. Or, try again via our
site in a week or so -- hopefully we'll have tracked down the problem by then.

Please do not reply to this mail. If you have a question or comment about the
site, please send an email to <?=$values['contact_email']?>
